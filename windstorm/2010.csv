Pentti (FMI) Hannelore III (FUB) – On 21–22 March, an area of low pressure drew across western Norway. In Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane many places saw more than 100 mm (3.9 in) of precipitation in 24 hours, resulting in several landslides, which among other things led to five homes being evacuated in Nordheimsund. From 24 March an area of high pressure began to build across southern and mid Norway. The low passed over Finland leaving 20,000 without power."

These storms brought with them warm and humid/moist air from the south west.
Jorun (Norway) (unnamed by FUB) – In early March high pressure built over UK and western Europe for first time in months (since December), directing the Atlantic storm path to the north. An area of low pressure designated extreme weather and named Jorun by Norwegian Meteorological Institute on 8 March 2014 brought hurricane-force winds to northern Norway.
Kyrre (Norway) – Another extreme weather event named by Norwegian Meteorological Institute as Kyrre affected north (Nordland and Troms) Norway on 13–14 March with extreme precipitation and wind. Up to 90 mm (3.5 in) fell in 24 hours, flooding, landslides and closing roads in Nordland and Troms.
Carl (DMI) Ev (FUB) – 14–15 March. An intense low pressure brought high winds which damaged buildings and forestry in southern Norway on 14 March, with Hordaland recording the strongest winds in 20 years. though the low didn't reach hurricane strength in Denmark. Investigated by Perils AG and non-qualifying (losses less than €200 million).
