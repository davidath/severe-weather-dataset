Erwin (Gudrun) 5–12 January 2005. Northern Europe was hit by the storm Erwin (Free University of Berlin), also called Gudrun by the Norwegian weather service, with sustained wind speeds of 126 km/h (78 mph) and wind gusts of 165 km/h (103 mph). About 341,000 homes lost power in Sweden and several thousand of these were out of power for many days and even weeks; about 10,000 homes were still without power after three weeks. The international death toll was at least 17. The storm caused a lot of financial damage in Sweden, where the forest industry suffered greatly from damaged trees. In the south, 75 million m3 (98 million cu yd) of trees blew down. In the space of 6 hrs, 250,000,000 trees were blown down, and after months of hard work, lorries and drivers from across Europe eventually transported the logs to several sites across the south of Sweden. One huge site was situated on a disused airfield, stretched for 2 km (1.2 mi), 14 m (46 ft) in height, and 10 piles in width. This was only 2% of the total logs stored, enough to create a 3 m × 3 m (9.8 ft × 9.8 ft) pile all the way to Australia.

At least 53 people were killed in northern and central Europe, causing travel chaos across the region. Britain and Germany were the worst hit, with eleven people killed as rain and gusts of up to 99 mph (159 km/h) with sustained windspeeds of up to 73 mph (117 km/h) swept the UK. Thirteen people were killed in Germany, with the weather station on top of the Brocken in the Saxony-Anhaltian Harz mountain range recording wind speeds of up to 195 km/h (121 mph). Direct damage in Germany was estimated to amount to €4.7bn. Five people were killed in the Netherlands and three in France. The gusts reached 151 km/h (94 mph) at the Cap Gris Nez and 130 km/h (81 mph) in many places in the north of France. In both Germany and the Netherlands the national railways were closed.
