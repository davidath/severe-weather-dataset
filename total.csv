Great Storm of 1987;Windstorm;1987-10-15 00:00:00;France,United Kingdom;N/A;46,54.75844;2,-2.69531;"This storm mainly affected southeastern England and northern France. In England maximum mean wind speeds of 70 kn (81 mph; 130 km/h) (an average over 10 minutes) were recorded. The highest gust of 117 kn (135 mph; 217 km/h) was recorded at Pointe du Raz in Brittany. In all, 19 people were killed in England and 4 in France. 15 million trees were uprooted in England. This storm received much media attention, not so much because of its severity, but because these storms do not usually track so far south, the trees and buildings are not used to such winds (indeed, in mid-October most deciduous trees still have their leaves and were therefore more susceptible to windstorm damage and, following weeks of wet weather, the ground was sodden, providing little grip for the trees' roots), the severity of the storm was not forecast until approximately 3 hrs before it hit and it struck after midnight, meaning few people had advance warning.[

DNMI estimated the strongest sustained winds (10 min average) to have reached 90 kn (100 mph; 170 km/h), comparable to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Very few fatalities occurred, mainly due to the very low population of the islands and the fact that the islanders are used to very high winds.

DNMI estimated the strongest sustained winds (10 min average) to have reached 90 kn (100 mph; 170 km/h), comparable to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Very few fatalities occurred, mainly due to the very low population of the islands and the fact that the islanders are used to very high winds.

Erwin (Gudrun) 5–12 January 2005. Northern Europe was hit by the storm Erwin (Free University of Berlin), also called Gudrun by the Norwegian weather service, with sustained wind speeds of 126 km/h (78 mph) and wind gusts of 165 km/h (103 mph). About 341,000 homes lost power in Sweden and several thousand of these were out of power for many days and even weeks; about 10,000 homes were still without power after three weeks. The international death toll was at least 17. The storm caused a lot of financial damage in Sweden, where the forest industry suffered greatly from damaged trees. In the south, 75 million m3 (98 million cu yd) of trees blew down. In the space of 6 hrs, 250,000,000 trees were blown down, and after months of hard work, lorries and drivers from across Europe eventually transported the logs to several sites across the south of Sweden. One huge site was situated on a disused airfield, stretched for 2 km (1.2 mi), 14 m (46 ft) in height, and 10 piles in width. This was only 2% of the total logs stored, enough to create a 3 m × 3 m (9.8 ft × 9.8 ft) pile all the way to Australia.

Erwin (Gudrun) 5–12 January 2005. Northern Europe was hit by the storm Erwin (Free University of Berlin), also called Gudrun by the Norwegian weather service, with sustained wind speeds of 126 km/h (78 mph) and wind gusts of 165 km/h (103 mph). About 341,000 homes lost power in Sweden and several thousand of these were out of power for many days and even weeks; about 10,000 homes were still without power after three weeks. The international death toll was at least 17. The storm caused a lot of financial damage in Sweden, where the forest industry suffered greatly from damaged trees. In the south, 75 million m3 (98 million cu yd) of trees blew down. In the space of 6 hrs, 250,000,000 trees were blown down, and after months of hard work, lorries and drivers from across Europe eventually transported the logs to several sites across the south of Sweden. One huge site was situated on a disused airfield, stretched for 2 km (1.2 mi), 14 m (46 ft) in height, and 10 piles in width. This was only 2% of the total logs stored, enough to create a 3 m × 3 m (9.8 ft × 9.8 ft) pile all the way to Australia.

Wind speeds of 134 mph (216 km/h) (equivalent to a weak Category 4 hurricane) were recorded on North Rona and wind speeds in excess of 110 mph (180 km/h) measured on South Uist with 105 mph (169 km/h) on Barra in the 
Hebrides before the automatic station stopped reporting at 17:00 UTC. Surface pressure reached a minimum of 946 mb (27.9 inHg) to the west of Scotland. Stormy seas combined with high spring tides and caused flooding in low-lying coastal areas. One fatality occurred in Ireland and six in Scotland, including a family of five who were swept into the sea after fleeing their house on South Uist. At the height of the storm, 85,000 households in Scotland were without power. On the 13th, all Caledonian MacBrayne ferry services and train services in Scotland were suspended, and many roads were closed due to fallen trees. The Forth Road Bridge was closed for the first time since the 1998 Boxing Day Storm, and the Tay (Dundee) and Friarton (Perth) bridges were also closed to all traffic."

Erwin (Gudrun) 5–12 January 2005. Northern Europe was hit by the storm Erwin (Free University of Berlin), also called Gudrun by the Norwegian weather service, with sustained wind speeds of 126 km/h (78 mph) and wind gusts of 165 km/h (103 mph). About 341,000 homes lost power in Sweden and several thousand of these were out of power for many days and even weeks; about 10,000 homes were still without power after three weeks. The international death toll was at least 17. The storm caused a lot of financial damage in Sweden, where the forest industry suffered greatly from damaged trees. In the south, 75 million m3 (98 million cu yd) of trees blew down. In the space of 6 hrs, 250,000,000 trees were blown down, and after months of hard work, lorries and drivers from across Europe eventually transported the logs to several sites across the south of Sweden. One huge site was situated on a disused airfield, stretched for 2 km (1.2 mi), 14 m (46 ft) in height, and 10 piles in width. This was only 2% of the total logs stored, enough to create a 3 m × 3 m (9.8 ft × 9.8 ft) pile all the way to Australia.

Gale-force winds were recorded in the south of the United Kingdom and in the Midlands, and gusts of over 50 mph (80 km/h) affected the entire country. Northern areas received gusts of between 60 and 90 mph (97 and 145 km/h). The depression was named Franz by the Free University of Berlin.
Six fatalities have been confirmed, along with several injuries. Five people were killed when a trawler sank off the coast near

In preparation for the storm, the Met Office issued a red wind warning for the Scottish Central Belt. Most schools in Scotland were closed by lunchtime. The Forth, Tay, Erskine and Skye Bridges were all closed due to strong winds.  The summit of CairnGorm recorded a gust up to 165 mph (266 km/h), also recording sustained winds up to 105 mph (169 km/h).

Carl (DMI) Ev (FUB) – 14–15 March. An intense low pressure brought high winds which damaged buildings and forestry in southern Norway on 14 March, with Hordaland recording the strongest winds in 20 years. though the low didn't reach hurricane strength in Denmark. Investigated by Perils AG and non-qualifying (losses less than €200 million).
Pentti (FMI) Hannelore III (FUB) – On 21–22 March, an area of low pressure drew across western Norway. In Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane many places saw more than 100 mm (3.9 in) of precipitation in 24 hours, resulting in several landslides, which among other things led to five homes being evacuated in Nordheimsund. From 24 March an area of high pressure began to build across southern and mid Norway. The low passed over Finland leaving 20,000 without power."
